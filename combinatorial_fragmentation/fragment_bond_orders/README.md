## Calculate Wiberg Bond Order distributions

For every fragment from the combinatorial fragmentation scheme, generate 
Omega conformers and calculate:
1. ELF Wiberg Bond Order estimate. This is a single value for the conformational distribution
2. Wiberg Bond Order for each individual conformer

## Manifest
* `compute_oe_wbo.py` - compute wbos for parent and fragments. Each fragment
was written out separately for computational efficiency. This script then saves the conformations
to `fragment_conformations/` so I do not need to regenerate the conformers if we want higher level QC WBOs
* `submit_oe_wbo.py` - script to submit computation to queue
* `oe_wbo.lsf` - dummy LSF submit script
* `combine_fragments.py` - script to combine individual fragment WBOs so they are 
grouped by the same corresponding bond in parent molecule. 
* `combine_fragments.lsf` - dummy sumbit script to combine fragments
* `submit_combine.py` - script to submit all combining jobs to the queue
* `validation_set/` - data generated by the scripts. The JSON files are in Lilac and organized as follows:
    * `drug_name/drug_name_frag_i_j_oe_wbo.json` - WBO for each fragment. i is the fragment index, j is the index for the same fragment with a different map to parent   
    * `drug_name/drug_name_parent_oe_wbo.json` - WBO for parent 
    * `drug_name/drug_name_oe_failed_fragments.json` - list of SMILES that OE failed to charge. 
    * `drug_name/drug_name_oe_wbos.json` - WBO distributions clustered by bonds
