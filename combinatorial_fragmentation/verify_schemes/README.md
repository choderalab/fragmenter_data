## Verify WBO fragmenter

Run QC torsion scans for fragments from WBO fragmenter scheme and Pfizer scheme. Compare to QC scan of parent molecule

Molecules to run:
* Menadiol_diphosphate_0 (9, 18) phosphate. Has negative o
* Phenformin_3 (13, 7) (protonated nitrogen)
* Cimetindine_5 (16, 5) (nitrile)
* Furosemide_0 (14, 7) sulfonamide. Has negative o
* Chloroprocain_0 (7, 17) (protonated nitrogen)
* Dextrothyroxine_0 (8, 20) (deprotonated oxygen) Has negative o
* Admetionine_0 (15, 6) sulfur
* Nitazoxanide_0 (14, 9) nitro


* Furosemide_0 (8 20) (deprotonated o)
* Admetionine_0 (19, 10) (Sulfur)

* "Ademetionine_0": ["[15, 6]","[19, 10]"] - some problems with stereochemistry
