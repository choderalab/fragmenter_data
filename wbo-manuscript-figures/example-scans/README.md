## Representative torsion scans from the subsituted phenyl set

This figure shows an example of a series of scans where the ELF10 AM1 WBO captures the increasing barrier heights
and the corresponding anti correlated wiberg bond order scans. It also shows an example of a series of scans where
the torsion profile also changes. The corresponding wiberg scans are not perfectly anti correlated but do all have the same
profile which is curious and I am not sure why that happens. It might be because the changes in the profile come about
because of steric clashes that are independent of the electron population overlap.
