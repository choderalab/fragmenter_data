## Illustrate results of combinatorial fragmenation with Dabrafenib

Scripts and data used to generate figure 9

## Manifest
* `generate_figure.py` - script used to generate figures
* `Dabrafenib_oe_by_bond_with_parent.zip` - zipped JSON file of all fragments confomration WBOs generated from combinatorial fragmentation
of Dabrafenib, will all conformer WBOs, organized by fragments that contain bonds in keys
* `Dabrafenib_fragments.json` - JSON of all fragments generated by combinatorial fragmentation.
* `ridge_plot.pdf` - Joy plot of all WBO distributions
* `pareto_front.pdf` - scatter of computational cost vs distance score with front plotted on most optimal fragments
* `fragments.pdf` - Fragments to illustrate important remote chemical changes. Bonds are highlighted with distance score
