## Manifest
* `generate_figure.py` - script to generate visualization of selected molecules and bonds. The data was taken from
the results of combinatorial fragmentation, specifically [this](https://github.com/choderalab/fragmenter_data/blob/bond_order/combinatorial_fragmentation/rank_fragments/select_validation_set.py)
script
* `selected.pdf` - output of the script. The pages were combined manually to generate the figure used in the paper.
