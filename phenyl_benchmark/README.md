## Phenyl benchmark

The phenyl benchmark is a set of molecules that isolate the resonance and inductive effect
from sterics by varying the chemical environment around the torsion via changing substituents
more than 2 bonds away from the central bond. This is achieved by attaching various 
substitutents to an aromatic ring and varying the meta and para positions. 

## Manifest
* `phenyls.smi` - combinatorial set of phenyls with R1 and R2 at meta and para positions
* `pyridine_ortho.smi` - combinatorial set of pyridine with N at ortho position. R2s are at meta and para position. 
This was not used in the final analysis becuase the N it less than 2 bonds away from central bond at R1. 
* `pyridine_meta.smi` - combinatorial set of pyridine with N at meta position of R1. R2s are at the para positions
* `pyridine_para.smi` - combinatorial set of pyridine with N are para position to R1. R2s are at meta positions.
